# climtools

Description:
------------
This module provides utility functions and constants for data analysis,processing, and file operations, with support for xarray, Dask, and CDO-based workflows.


The climtools library I am calling a “package” in quotes because it currently has the core structure of any package you would install using conda or pip; there is an __init__.py file that allows you to access all of the library’s modules and the functions within, using a single from pathlib import Path

from climtools import * command. However, this “package” is not available through conda or pip yet. In the meantime, you can get the package by cloning the repo.
